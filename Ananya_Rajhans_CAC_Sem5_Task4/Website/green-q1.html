      <p class="in-the-early">
        In the early to mid-20th century, the gender wage gap was deeply
        entrenched in societies across the globe. There were relatively few
        women in the workforce, primarily due to cultural and societal norms
        that dictated that a woman's primary role was within the home. Those who
        did enter the workforce often faced barriers in terms of educational
        opportunities. Women were often directed towards more menial roles, such
        as assembly line workers or personal secretaries, and were largely
        absent from professional fields. The prevailing belief was that women
        were inherently less capable than men, both intellectually and
        physically, reinforcing stereotypes that limited their access to
        education and professional opportunities. These cultural norms
        perpetuated the idea that women should focus on raising children and
        maintaining households, rather than pursuing careers or positions of
        power.
