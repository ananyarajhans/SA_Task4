          <span>
            Over a person's career, the gender pay gap can widen with age. This
            is because women may face obstacles in career progression, such as
            taking breaks for caregiving responsibilities, which can lead to
            lower lifetime earnings compared to their male counterparts.

          <span
            >Younger women may face a narrower pay gap when starting their
            careers, as they may be more likely to enter the workforce with
            similar qualifications and expectations as their male peers.

          <span>
            As employees progress in their careers, the gender pay gap may
            widen. This can be due to factors like gender bias in promotions,
            lack of access to high-level positions, and the tendency for men to
            negotiate higher salaries.

          <span class="lifetime-earnings">Ageism and Retirement:</span>
          <span>
            Both men and women may face age-related challenges in the workforce.
            However, older women may face additional barriers due to a
            combination of ageism and gender bias, which can lead to lower pay
            and reduced opportunities.</span
